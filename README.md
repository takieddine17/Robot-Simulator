### 🛡️ Windows Users – SmartScreen Warning?

When running the game for the first time, Windows Defender SmartScreen might show a warning:

> “Windows protected your PC”

This happens because the game is new and not signed. To run it safely:

1. Click **“More info”**
2. Click **“Run anyway”**

This will launch the game. It’s safe to run if you downloaded it from this official GitHub release.
